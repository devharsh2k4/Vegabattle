    #VegaBattle

    VegaBattle is a gamified competitive coding platform designed to make coding challenges more engaging and exciting. The platform allows users to participate in versus battles, where two individuals face off in real-time coding challenges. Each player can place a bet, creating a prize pool that the winner takes home after the competition.

    In addition to head-to-head battles, the platform also features a solo mode where individual users can tackle coding challenges and earn rewards through a path of achievements. This mode tracks users' progress and provides a sense of growth and accomplishment.

    The platform aims to combine the thrill of competition with skill-building, making coding more interactive and fun. By integrating features like matchmaking, ranking, and leaderboards, the platform encourages friendly competition, while ensuring fair play and a motivating experience for all participants.
