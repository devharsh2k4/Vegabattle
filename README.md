    #VegaBattle

    VegaBattle is a gamified competitive coding platform designed to make coding challenges more engaging and exciting. The platform allows users to participate in versus battles, where two individuals face off in real-time coding challenges. Each player can place a bet, creating a prize pool that the winner takes home after the competition.

By integrating features like matchmaking, ranking, and leaderboards, the platform encourages friendly competition, while ensuring fair play and a motivating experience for all participants.
